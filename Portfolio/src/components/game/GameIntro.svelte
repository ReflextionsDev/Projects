            As a solo developer, I've worn many hats. I've taken games through
            their full lifecycle: handling all aspects of designing, developing,
            testing, and publishing. But I'm no stranger to getting in the
            weeds. I follow the idea of a Ï€ shaped skillset, wherein I specialize
            in design and development.

            I've published projects on Steam, Google Play, and the App Store. My
            HTML5 games have reached millions of players and I've participated in a few game jams. I've worked as a freelancer on many projects, including apps, educational games, and games published as op-eds.
